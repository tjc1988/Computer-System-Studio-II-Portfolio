    <h2>The Giver book project - Alternate ending</h2>
        <p>This was an assignment / project for my Acemdemic Conversations course in the Spring 2019 semester.</p>
            <p>During the semester we had to read The Giver. For this assignment, we had to use The Giver as the topic and had<br>
            several choices of what kind of project we could use. I choose the option of creating an alternate ending and<br>
            had to read it to the class.</p>
