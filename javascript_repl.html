    <h2>JavaScript repl programs</h2>
        <p>This is a list of JavaScript programs that I made using repl in the Programming 1 course<br>
           in the Spring 2020 semester. The list starts with the most recent to the oldest.</p>
    <br>

    <a href="https://Take-Home-Lab-4-version-2--tjc1988.repl.co" target="_blank">Website example (version 2)</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we were given a wireframe for a webpage and we had to<br>
       make a webpage to its specifications. I didn't get it exactly like the wireframe but it was<br>
       very close. Later I found some of the errors and fixed them in version 2.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://Take-Home-Lab-2--tjc1988.repl.co" target="_blank">Address form program</a>
    <p>This program has a form that you fill out that would be similar to an address form on a<br>
       website when making an order. The main objective for this assignment was to program it so that<br>
       when you press the submit button, it will display the address that you entered in the correct<br>
       format that you would typically see an address written.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://Take-Home-Lab-1--tjc1988.repl.co" target="_blank">Swimming pool volume calulation</a>
    <p>This is a HTML file that uses JavaScript to calculate the volume of a pool with preset number values.</p>
