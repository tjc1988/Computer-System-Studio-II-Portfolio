    <h2>P5.js programs</h2>
        <p>This is a list of programs that I made using P5.js in the Computing Principles course<br>
           in the Fall 2019 semester. The list starts with the most recent to the oldest.</p>

    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/dGMcMMvD_" target="_blank">Bullets</a>
    <p>This was a modified version of an in-class example where we dealt with using arrays and intersecting objects<br>
	to have "bullet" objects remove other objects from an array list.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/AnzwtANbi" target="_blank">OOP Assignment</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we had to use Object Orientated Programming and have an action happen when<br>
	the mouse was pressed.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/_VScAZAyp" target="_blank">Milk and Cereal</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we were introduced to Object Orientated Programming and importing media to<br>
	P5js.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/o654HJP_n" target="_blank">Rotation checkerboards</a>
    <p>This was a modified version of my Checkerboard repeat function program and was for an assigment where we<br>
	needed to add functional buttons into the program.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/9jXKY-vVK" target="_blank">Color Boxes converted to functions</a>
    <p>This is a modified version of my Color Boxes program for an assignment where we could either convert a<br>
	previous program to use fucntions or create a new program that used functions.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/cq4E85pIu" target="_blank">Checkerboard repeat function</a>
    <p>This is a modified version of my Checkerboard converted to functions program that was for an assignment<br>
	where we used the function several times and used different arguments for each function.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/S478aEPKz" target="_blank">Checkerboard converted to function</a>
    <p>This is a modified version of the Checkerboard loops program that was for an assignment where we were<br>
	introduced to fucntions and needed to convert the Checkerboard loops program to use functions.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/gsExcyuSE" target="_blank">Checkerboard loops</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we were introduced to loops and had to make a checkerboard using loops.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/Pm5p07AqA" target="_blank">Thermometer</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we had to use the mouse position to control the thermometer.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/V6tn0t4Q1" target="_blank">Color Boxes</a>
    <p>This was for an assignment where we had to make a simple program so I went with a program that whatever<br>
	box you clicked on would turn the large box at the top the same color.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tjc1988/sketches/tP8Lz0GjF" target="_blank">Uh Oh!</a>
