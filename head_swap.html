    <h2>Head swap project</h2>
        <p>This was for an assignment in the Computer System Studio 1 course in the Fall 2019 semester.</p>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to find a picture that had two or more people in it and use<br>
            Photoshop to switch at least two heads around onto other bodies. In this picture I switched<br>
            the two men's heads</p>
