    <h2>Alfred Hitchcock video edit project</h2>
        <p>This was for an assignment in the Hardware and Networking course in the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
        <p>This assignment was related to the <a href = "https://tylersgroup.tech.blog/2020/03/27/lab-6-editing-video/" target = "_blank">Lab 6 - Editing Video</a> assignment</p>
        <p>For this assignment, we had to use the video "Hitchcock Loves Bikinis" and use video editing<br>
           to make it look like he was looking at something other than what was in the original video<br>
           clip. We had to use at least three images and a music track.</p>
