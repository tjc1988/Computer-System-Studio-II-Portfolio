    <h2>Creating a composite project</h2>
        <p>This was for an assignment in the Computer System Studio 1 course in the Fall 2019 semester.</p>
        <p>The goal of this assignemnt was to use Photoshop and use a picture as a background and then<br>
            copy an item from another image and then use a mask to copy an item from another image and<br>
            also use some text. The forest is the background image and the two runners and dog were<br>
            copied from other images.</p>
