    <h2>Website banner ad</h2>
        <p>This was for an assignment in the Computer System Studio 1 course in the Fall 2019 semester.</p>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a "website banner" that would be similar in size to<br>
           an ad that you might see on a website. A few rules was that we had to copy items from other<br>
            images and also use text.</p>
